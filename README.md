I'm using the API developed in Go created by my friend Cyro, now I'm creating the frontend in ReactJs

let's code!

## Back-End Application

Check the Hexagony Back-end: https://github.com/cyruzin/hexagony

There's a online version running on Heroku: https://hexagony.herokuapp.com

## Running

There's a online version running on Vercel: https://hexagony.vercel.app/

or

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
